I'm an almost middle aged biology student with enough kids to have a permanent mom voice. Towards the end of my run at a bach degree, one of my kids ended up on some pretty serious antibiotics. All of the advice I was given was "give her some probiotics." I'm not getting into the whethers and wherefores, but I wasn't going to give my kid unregulated supplements without testing them first. I built a $100 temperature controlled incubator with a plastic tote, an incandescent bulb, and a temperature controller and Bio in the Basement was born.
